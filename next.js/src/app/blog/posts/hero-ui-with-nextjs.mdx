## Example: A Responsive Card Component
<CodeBlock
    label="Card.jsx"
    codes={[
        {
            code: `function Card({ title, description, image }) {
    return (
      <div className="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
        <img className="w-full" src={image} alt={title} />
        <div className="px-6 py-4">
          <div className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">{title}</div>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-base">{description}</p>
