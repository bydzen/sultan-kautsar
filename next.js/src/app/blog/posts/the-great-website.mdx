## About

Creating a great website isn't just about good looks or technical precision — it's about what happens _between_ them. It's the conversation between design and code that brings a website to life. When these two sides are in sync, the result is not only beautiful, but intuitive, fast, and accessible.

## The Importance of Collaboration

Design and development often feel like two different worlds. But when they collaborate early, everything flows better — from user experience to performance.

Instead of designers handing off static mockups and hoping for the best, real collaboration happens when developers are involved in design discussions, and designers understand technical constraints.

This mindset avoids the common "pixel-perfect" trap and focuses more on what really matters: clarity, usability, and performance.

### ✦ Example: A Clean and Reusable Button Component

<CodeBlock
    label="Button.jsx"
    codes={[
        {
            code: `function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button
      className="px-4 py-2 rounded bg-black text-white hover:bg-gray-800 transition"
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}`,
            language: "jsx",
            label: "Button.jsx",
        },
    ]}
/>

## Understanding User Needs

At the heart of every good site is a deep understanding of the user. Designers shape the experience, while developers make it real — and usable across different devices and scenarios.

That only works if both teams care about the user journey, not just their part of the process.

### ✦ Example: Semantic HTML for Better Accessibility

<CodeBlock
    label="HeroSection.html"
    codes={[
        {
            code: `<section class="hero">
  <h1>Welcome to Rayatiga</h1>
  <p>We bridge design and code to build impactful websites.</p>
  <a href="#projects" class="btn-primary">See Our Work</a>
</section>`,
            language: "html",
            label: "HeroSection.html",
        },
    ]}
/>

## The Role of Communication

Smooth collaboration relies on good communication. That includes feedback loops, async updates, shared language, and tools that make working together easier.

Designers might share components in Figma, while developers map them to reusable code structures. This reduces guesswork and keeps everything consistent.

### ✦ Example: Using CSS Variables for Consistent Design Tokens

<CodeBlock
    label="theme.css"
    
    codes={[
        {
            code: `:root {
  --color-primary: #111827;
  --color-accent: #3b82f6;
  --font-sans: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}

.btn-primary {
background: var(--color-accent);
color: white;
padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
border-radius: 0.375rem;
transition: background 0.2s ease;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
background: #2563eb;
}`,
language: "css",
label: "theme.css",
},
]}
/>

## Conclusion

Great websites aren't built in silos. They come from conversations — between ideas and execution, between design and code.

By embracing collaboration, sharing user goals, and keeping the communication clear, teams can build sites that don't just look good, but work beautifully too.
