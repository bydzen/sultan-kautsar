                <h1>Sultan Kautsar</h1>
                <p>Greetings. I'm <a href="https://sultankautsar.com">Sultan Kautsar</a>, catalyst of innovation in the realm of tech and commerce. My optimism is a beacon that illuminates even the darkest corners of the digital labyrinth.</p>
                <p>I've founded <a href="https://rayatiga.com" target="_blank">Rayatiga</a>, a sanctuary for static web development, where pixels dance to creative command. Landing pages, portfolios, and digital identities are my canvas, and I wield the brushstrokes of code with finesse.</p>
                <p><a href="https://telkomuniversity.ac.id" target="_blank">Telkom University</a> provided me with a strong foundation for my academic success. I earned a cum laude degree with a GPA of 3.74, which I attribute to hard work and perseverance.</p>
                <p><a href="https://breefstudio.com" target="_blank">Breef Studio</a> served as a valuable stepping stone in my career, where I honed my web development skills as a full-time developer. While I appreciate the experience, I'm eager to take on new challenges and explore further opportunities.</p>
