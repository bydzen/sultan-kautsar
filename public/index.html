                <h2>The Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Sultan Kautsar. I've always been curious about how technology can genuinely help people, not just impress them. That curiosity led me to build Rayatiga, not to chase big titles but to create solutions that quietly make a difference for businesses trying to grow.</p>
                <p>I focus on WordPress development and love working with small and medium enterprises because they're driven by real passion. For me, technology isn't about showing off, it's about making things work better for real people.</p>
                <p>My background in Information Technology from Telkom University has shaped my technical skills in web development, cloud engineering, and business innovation. But I believe what matters even more is sincerity. I deliver every project carefully, listen first, and build with heart.</p>
                <p>I'm always happy to meet people who share this mindset: to innovate not for the sake of being "modern," but to create meaningful impact together. If that resonates with you, feel free to reach out.</p>
